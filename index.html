      <p>
        The owners of a Queens nursing home with a record of neglect and safety violations are in court again this week, battling over money.
      </p>

      <p>
        Helen Webster, part owner of Meadow Park Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center in Fresh Meadows, is suing her business partner, nursing home magnate Ben Landa, saying he has been withholding her share of millions of dollars.
      </p>

      <p>
        The conference comes a week before the co-owners’ complaint against White Rock will be heard in court.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, Meadow Park residents and their families say none of that money is being reinvested into the home, and the residents are suffering.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the time period covered by the lawsuit, Meadow Park refinanced its mortgage and, the lawsuit alleges, borrowed an additional $8 million from a bank. That nearly tripled the home’s cash on hand compared to the previous year, records show.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inspection reports from the same period show that the home was cited for multiple health violations, including a faulty boiler that heated residents’ bathwater to dangerously high temperatures. In another incident, a resident was forced to
        sit in a soiled diaper for two and a half hours. The nursing assistant tasked with changing her said she was too busy taking care of other patients, according to inspection reports.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inspectors fined Meadow Park over $45,000 for these and other violations, making it one of the ten most fined homes in New York state. It’s also one of the seven percent of the state’s 621 nursing homes listed as having “serious
        deficiencies” by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
      </p>

      <p>
        This pattern of neglect doesn’t surprise Elizabeth Chase, whose aunt, Helena Jones, stayed at the nursing home for a short period in 2016.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It didn’t smell okay at all,” she said. “It smelled like used Depends underwear, bananas, and trash all the time.”
      </p>

      <p>
        While NYCity News Service reporters detected no odor when they visited the facility in 2018, records show that Meadow Park is still deficient in other ways: the facility has one star, or Medicare’s lowest possible rating, for staffing.
        That’s well below the New York state median of 3 stars, and puts Meadow Park in the bottom 23 percent of New York state nursing homes for staffing.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If you don’t have enough staff, you can’t even meet the very basic level of needs of an individual,” said Robyn Grant, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, an advocacy group for
        nursing home residents. “There’s a terrible physical toll.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Residents in understaffed nursing homes are more prone to bedsores, malnutrition, and falls, all of which are especially dangerous for older adults, Grant explained.
      </p>

      <p>
        In especially understaffed homes, residents who need assistance may not get that help for hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        Elizabeth Chase said she saw this firsthand. When Chase asked nursing staff to apply some ointment to her aunt’s back, it was more than an hour before she got help.
      </p>

      <p>
        Residents in understaffed homes are also at risk of being inappropriately prescribed antipsychotic medications, Grant said, which can have serious side effects for seniors, including increased risk of heart attack and stroke.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2.4 percent of Meadow Park’s short-stay residents received an antipsychotic medication for the first time, compared to the New York state average of 1.6 percent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Among long-stay residents, though, Meadow Park’s rate is seven percent—less than the state average of 12 percent.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, CMS gave Meadow Park 5 stars, both its median and highest rating, for quality of resident care, a measure that takes into account residents’ pain levels, independence, and other factors. Shirley Bouie, who stayed at Meadow Park,
        said that the facility was clean and the staff was kind during her stay.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If I ever have to go back to rehab, that would be the place for me to go to,” she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 2017 lawsuit is the latest in a long-running legal feud between Landa and Webster. The pair, who share ownership in several nursing homes throughout the state, have been suing each other regularly since 2004.
      </p>

      <iframe src='https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1Oc5voMVBpox3LNNGkayRC8NSAXpeyaq41ZanNzVroY0&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=1&height=650' width='100%' height='650' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen frameborder='0'></iframe>

      <p>
        While the most recent complaint alleges wrongdoing against Meadow Park as an institution—claiming, for instance, that Landa paid his own companies from Meadow Park’s coffers for overinflated “management fees”—Webster’s demands are focused
        mainly on receiving what she alleges is her unpaid share of the proceeds from the mortgage refinancing and bank loan.
      </p>

      <p>
        “These lawsuits are usually just tactical,” said Peter Mahler, a New York attorney whose specialty is “business divorce,” or the dissolution of business relationship.
      </p>

      <p>
        “They’re not looking to blow up the company,” continued Mahler, who isn’t involved in the lawsuit. “They just want to make the lives of the other side as miserable as possible so they’ll pay them what they want to leave.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Webster, Landa, and their attorneys declined to comment, saying they can’t speak about ongoing litigation. But John S. Cahalan, Landa’s attorney, said after their latest court date that he expects it may be weeks or months before the judge
        rules on their motion to dismiss.
      </p>

      <p>
        Representatives from Meadow Park did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Elizabeth Chase often passes by Meadow Park on her way to classes at Pace University. As the bus rolls down 164th Street, past the beige building with the manicured lawn, she thinks about the struggle to get even the most basic care for her
        aunt, who passed away a few months after her stay.

        “They wouldn’t let her go, but they weren’t treating her,” said Chase. “Nothing was being done, and nobody was doing anything.”
